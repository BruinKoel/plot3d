WASD to fly, and you can click and drag the viewport to adjust your look direction
designpatterns are for the next great version, if that ever comes.
Also the whole wpf setup, is just terrible, but that wasn't the goal of this project.

The Goal of the project:
"To be determined"
Right now i am just testing the water of all this material, I take everything problem by problem, and whenever inspiritaion strikes i add some functionality.


Ideation phases:

phase 1, could i build a slicer? technically yes done. take an object slice it along the Z axis. 

phase 2 what if i used splines generated from the mesh, that way it's all smooth.

phase 3 already bored of finetuning my splines, besides ordering toolpaths has been done before, and better than i currently can. how can i do it different?

phase 4 what if i represent the volume instead of the srufaces of this object, True mathematical volumetric calculations based on my current code, will be too much effort but a tought for when i have the guts to jump in that rabbit hole.

current phase 5 voxels? or even more simple, field of scalar values? this feels good, because there could be a simple conversion to input variable for a model somewhere in there?
